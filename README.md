2. Download and install Maven 8 (http://maven.apache.org/download.html#Installation). If you have already installed Maven , you can skip this step.
3. Go the root directory of project (The one which contains the pom.xml file)
4. Import project to IDE as Existing Maven Project.
5. Run command mvn clean and Maven install
